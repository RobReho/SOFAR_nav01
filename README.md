# SOFAR_nav01

Very preliminar package.

## Packages
to execute the launch files it is necessary to have the "slam_gmapping" and the "robot_description" packages.

## Notes
I found a urdf of the husky robot used in the simulation. It is not launched in these files, here I used the model from the package robot_description. 
I don't think it is mandatory to use the husky anyway.
The model it is not opening right in Rviz, but maybe once the navigation part is lauched as well it will work.
